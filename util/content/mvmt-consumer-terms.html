      <h2>International Order Terms and Conditions</h2>

      <h3>Flow is the Seller of the Goods.</h3>

      <p>MVMT Watches, Inc. has partnered with Flow Commerce, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
      ("Flow") as a fulfillment provider to process and facilitate orders placed on www.mvmtwatches.com 
      which are to be shipped to an address outside the United States (“International Orders"). As a
      result, any such International Orders are governed by these International Order Terms and
      Conditions of Service. By confirming your International Order, you indicate that you accept
      and agree to these International Order Terms and Conditions in addition to any other terms and
      conditions required in relation to your purchase. In the event that these International Order
      Terms and Conditions conflict with other terms and conditions set by MVMT Watches, Inc. in relation
      to an International Order, these International Order Terms and Conditions shall apply.</p>

      <p>When completing your purchase on MVMT Watches, Inc.'s website and checkout page, you will be
      providing your payment details, shipping address and any additional information required to
      complete your order directly to Flow, and not to theMVMT Watches, Inc.</p>

      <p>Once your order has been approved, Flow will assume title to the goods you have ordered for
      purpose of fulfilling your International Order. Any payment associated with an International
      Order will be processed and accepted directly by Flow, as the seller of the goods to you
      (“Merchant of Record"). In addition, where it is required by law, rule or regulation, or
      where you elect to pre pay any applicable duties and taxes, Flow will collect any such duties
      and taxes with your payment and make payment to the appropriate taxing authority on your
      behalf. When Flow receives your payment details and any additional information related to your
      International Order, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Flow is entitled to verify and
      authenticate your payment information, and if it is unable to verify this information, a Flow
      representative may contact you and/or your payment card issuer to confirm your identity
      and/or your intent to place the order.</p>

      <p>Once the payment is processed, title in the goods will shift to you. Flow will then direct
      shipment of the goods by common carrier for delivery to the address indicated in your
      International Order.</p>

      <h3>Flow's Privacy Policy.</h3>

      <p>Flow's Privacy Policy, which applies to Flow's collection, use, disclosure and other processing
      of personal information, is located at
      <a href="/policies/privacy">https://www.flow.io/policies/privacy</a>. You consent
      to the personal and other information that Flow may obtain about you being collected, stored
      and otherwise processed in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h3>Payments Accepted in Your Currency.</h3>

      <p>All payments collected in relation to International Orders will be processed on the Flow payments
      system. At checkout, you may select your preferred currency and payment method from those listed as
      available currencies and payment methods. Flow will present the purchase price to you in your
      preferred currency. Please note that prices in different countries and currencies may vary. When you
      complete and confirm payment, you are indicating that you agree and accept the presented price as
      the purchase price.</p>

      <p>You may contact Flow directly via email at <a href="mailto:help@flow.io">help@flow.io</a> or at +1 (929) 265-2865 (USA) or +353
76 8888902 (EU). While Flow is the seller of the goods, or Merchant of Record, you may direct any
      inquiries, questions or comments regarding the goods you have purchased—including returns and
      refunds to the MVMT Watches, Inc. or at our customer service number +1 (888) 507-0220. We will be happy to assist and we will

      Orders. Nothing hereby prejudices your rights under the EU Consumer Rights Directive</p>

      <h3>Returns</h3>

      <p>Flow's standard return policy is that we do not accept returns. If Flow's supplier, MVMT Watches, Inc.,
      has a return policy that allows for international returns, Flow may extend MVMT Watches, Inc's return
      policy to its consumers as well.</p>

      <h3>General Terms.</h3>

      <p>By placing your International Order, you indicate that you agree and accept the following terms:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Flow has no obligation to process the payment for your order until the order has been
        accepted, and Flow reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit
        content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion;</li>
        <li>In some jurisdictions, Flow utilizes contracted third parties under strict confidentiality and
        data protection requirements for purposes of payment processing services.</li>
        <li>If you elect to use a payment card or other electronic form of payment for purchase of your
        International Order, the charges to your account will be accompanied by a descriptor referencing
        Flow and/or MVMT Watches, Inc.</li>
        <li>For your protection, Flow utilizes various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard
        verification systems to reduce fraud. As a condition of accepting your International Order, you
        must comply with such protocols and business risk policies, including but not limited to card
        authentication and “ship to" and “bill to" address verification. Once an order is placed, you may
        not change payment information or any “ship to"/“bill to" address. If a request for an
        International Order is declined by Flow or MVMT Watches, Inc. but payment is processed due to an error
        in the Flow payment system, that transaction shall be void.</li>
        <li>In the event that any items in your International Order are shipped separately or at
        different times, or in the event that your International Order is partially filled, you will only
        be charged for the goods actually shipped to you, including any shipping fees, duties, taxes, VAT
        and or other fees applicable to those goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Customs, Duties, Taxes and Collection Fees</strong>. You are responsible for payment
        of the estimated value of any import taxes, sales tax, value added tax, and customs duties that
        may be levied by any government authority, and any disbursement fees, advancement fees or
        similar fees that may be imposed by the shipper, broker, the customs authority of the destination
        country or other party, including any additional penalties or fees imposed by applicable tax or
        customs authorities (collectively, “Duties, Taxes and Fees"). Flow shall be liable for any
        difference in the estimated Duties, Taxes and Fees and the actual Duties, Taxes and Fees due and
        payable upon entry to the destination country. You will never be asked to pay additional Duties,
        Taxes and Fees after checkout, nor will you be entitled to receive a refund of any portion of the
        estimated Duties, Taxes and Fees. In the event that you defer payment of any applicable Duties,
        Taxes and Fees for payment upon delivery, you are fully liable for payment in full of the Duties,
        Taxes and Fees at the time of delivery. If you fail to pay any applicable Duties, Taxes and Fees
        which become due upon delivery, any costs, Duties, Taxes and Fees which accrue in relation to the
        initial delivery and subsequent return of the International Order or portion thereof shall be
        deducted in full prior to a refund of the purchase price of returned goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Brokers</strong>. You hereby authorize a licensed customs broker chosen by Flow to act
        as your agent in working with foreign customs and revenue authorities to arrange for clearance of
        your International Order, and settle any duties and taxes on your behalf, if applicable. You
        hereby grant a proxy or power of attorney (“POA") to any common carrier or broker designated by
        Flow authorizing the assigned customs broker or agent to act on your behalf. You agree and
        acknowledge that you are the Importer of Record, and acknowledge that the granting of the POA is
        a reasonable condition of service provided by Flow and its designated carrier, broker or agent.</li>

        AVAILABLE" BASIS. FLOW MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

        CONTENT DISPLAYED ON OR ACCESSIBLE VIA THE SYSTEM. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE FLOW
        PAYMENT SYSTEM IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. FLOW DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR

        <li>You acknowledge and agree that the MVMT Watches, Inc. and Flow reserve their respective rights to
        analyze transactional data, anonymously and in aggregate, for the purpose of identifying trends,
        statistics and measurements that could contribute to the enhancement of MVMT Watches, Inc's customer
        experience and/or the Flow services. Any transactional data so analyzed will be aggregated and

        you are importing such products.</li>
        <li><strong>Electronic Communications</strong>. When you place an International Order, you are
        communicating with Flow electronically, and acknowledge and agree to enter into your purchase
        agreement by electronic means, and to receive communications from Flow electronically via
        email.</li>
        <li><strong>Modifications</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that the MVMT Watches, Inc. and Flow each
        reserve the right to make changes to its systems, policies, and these International Order Terms
        and Conditions at any time. If any or any portion of these International Order Terms and
        Conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term or portion
        of terms shall be deemed severable, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the
        remainder.</li>
