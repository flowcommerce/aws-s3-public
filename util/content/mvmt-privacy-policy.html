           accounts, checkouts, questionnaires, panels, and social media features,
           such as signing into a Flow Website account using your social media
           sign-in credentials or otherwise interacting with third party social media

      <h3>What Cookies and Other Technologies Does Flow Use?</h3>

      <p>A cookie is a small file downloaded on
      to a device when a user accesses certain websites. When you interact with Flow
      or its partners, cookies and other technologies may be used for storing
      information, and accessing information stored on your devices, such as your
      computer, mobile device or other device. These cookies and other technologies
      may include first party cookies (i.e., those placed by the website being
      visited) and third party cookies (i.e., those placed by a website other than
      the one being visited), local shared objects ("LSO," and commonly referred to
      as "Flash Cookies" or "HTML 5 Cookies") and tracking pixels (including
      transparent or clear gifs also known as "web beacons").</p>

      <p>Cookies can either expire at the end
      of a session ("Session Cookies") or be persistent and last through multiple
      sessions ("Persistent Cookies"). Session Cookies can be helpful for remembering
      items you put in your shopping cart as you browse a site, or for security
      reasons when you are providing financial information. Persistent Cookies are
      stored on your device in between sessions, which allows for your preferences or
      actions to be remembered and used on a website (or in some cases across
      different websites). Persistent Cookies may be helpful in remembering your
      preferences and choices when using a website or to ensure advertising messages
      are more relevant to you. Cookies are useful because they allow us to recognize
      your device and provide you with a high level of service and relevant offers. </p>

      <p>The Flow Websites may include Social
      Media Features, such as the Facebook "Like" button and widgets such as the "Share"
      button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Flow Websites. These
      Social Media Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting
      on a Flow Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
      properly. Social Media Features and widgets are either hosted by a third party
      or hosted directly on the Flow Websites. Your interactions with these Social
      Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the
      Social Media Feature.</p>

      <p>Broadly speaking, Cookies placed on
      your computer or device fall into two categories: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>First Party Cookies &mdash; these
        are served directly by us to your computer or device and are used only by us to
        recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our website; and</li>
        <li>Third Party Cookies &mdash;
        these are served by our service providers and partners on our website, and can
        be used by such parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when you
        use it to visit other websites.</li>

      <h3>How Can I Disable Cookies?</h3>

      <p>To limit disclosures and use of
        personal data - you can typically remove or reject Cookies via your browser
        settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser
        (usually located within the "settings", "help" "tools" or "edit" facility). Many browsers are set to accept Cookies
        until you change your settings. You
        can take additional steps to disable or delete similar data, such as Flash
        Cookies, by modifying the "add-on" settings on your browser. Various browsers
        may offer their own management tools for access to HTML5 LSOs. However,
        please note that certain Cookies are required for you to be able to take
        advantage of some of Flow"s important functions. For example, if you do not
        allow our cookies, you may not be able to purchase items from one of our
        checkouts. You may find specific instructions for disabling cookies in some of
        the popular browsers via the following links: <a
        href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416">Google Chrome</a>,

      <h3>Use of Cookies on Flow Websites.</h3>

      <p>In
      addition to any Cookies that may be set via our Site, with their permission, we
      may also set Cookies via our partners" Flow Websites to assist both them and
      you in our provision of the Flow Services.</p>

      <h3>How Does Flow Use and Share Your Information?</h3>

      <p>The type or identity of third parties
      to which Flow discloses personal information and the purpose is addressed
      herein. We use and retain your information as needed to provide you services, ship
      and track your order, maintain a record of your purchases and returns, comply
      with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and for other legitimate business
      reasons. By way of example, and not limitation, we analyze transactional data
      for the purpose of identifying trends, statistics and measurements that could
      contribute to the enhancement of Flow services. Such use could include
      identifying market sensitivities, and relative market interest in specific
      product categories. Another example would be if you place an order with us
      through a Flow Website, we (directly or through our merchant supplier or other
      entity on our behalf) may contact you if there is an issue with the order
      (e.g., to find an alternative to a restricted item).</p>

      <p>We do not sell your information to
      others and do not share your information with third parties other than as
      outlined in this Privacy Policy. However, there are certain situations where we
      may provide your information to third parties.</p>

      <ul>
       <li><strong>Marketplaces and Partners Involved in Your
           Transactions.</strong> Depending on how you interact with Flow, you may
           make purchases that involve third parties. For example, you may make a
           purchase that involves a third-party website or marketplace. In such a situation,
           you may initially view products on that website or marketplace and Flow is
           facilitating the order or otherwise involved. If this is the case, it will
           be very clear to you that a third party is involved in your transaction.
           And, if so, we may share your personal information with that third party.
        </li>
       <li><strong>Service Provider.</strong>Flow may
           provide your personal information to certain service providers in
           connection with the fulfillment of your purchase instructions, including
           but not limited to delivery agents, email service providers to send you
           emails on our behalf, customer support providers to process your feedback,
           customs brokers, international revenue authorities and fraud management
           parties. Flow will always attempt to limit the information we provide to
           be what is reasonably sufficient for those service providers to carry out
           their responsibilities as they relate to the fulfillment of your purchase
           instructions, and no service provider shall be authorized by us to use or
           disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our
           behalf or comply with legal requirements..
        </li>
       <li><strong>Flow"s Protection.</strong> We will
           disclose your personal information as required by law, when we believe
           that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a
           judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, to enforce or apply
           our Terms &amp; Conditions and other agreements and to protect the rights
           of Flow.</li>
       <li><strong>Business Transition.</strong> In the event
           Flow goes through a business transition, such as a merger with or
           acquisition by another company, sale of all or a portion of our assets or
           brands, your personal information will likely be among the assets
           transferred.</li>
       <li><strong>You Otherwise Consent.</strong> We may, of
           course, share your information in other ways that you specifically consent
           to.</li>
       <li><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> We may
           disclose your personal information to law enforcement, government
           officials, public authorities or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled
           to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process, (ii) we must do
           so to comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations, including credit
           card rules, (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is
           necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected
           illegal activity, or to investigate violations of any rules, regulations,
           laws or this Privacy Policy.</li>
       <li><strong>Aggregated Content.</strong> We may also
           share "aggregated/blinded" information with our merchant partners, PR
           agencies, advertising agencies, and other third parties. By "aggregated/blinded"
           information we mean, information from multiple users that contains only
           zip codes, purchasing amounts, products, brands, categories, merchants
           involved, timing of transactions/usage and frequency of usage " with no
           other private information or personally identifying information included.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition, in the event of a merger,
      acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar events, certain
      information in our possession may be transferred to our successor or assign.</p>

      <h3>How Does Flow Handle, Store and Secure

      seriously at Flow. We use a variety of current technologies and processes to

      partners with anyone else.</p>

      partners and our clients where required.</p>

      <p>Information submitted by you may be
      transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in
      the circumstances described above (see How Does Flow Use and Share Your
      Information?), which may be situated in, or employ staff in, places other than your home jurisdiction,
      the U.S. and/or the European Economic Area (EEA).&nbsp; The countries concerned
      may not have similar data protection laws to your home jurisdiction, the US and

      steps to ensure that your privacy continue to be protected.&nbsp; By submitting
      information via the Flow Website, you agree to this storing, processing and/or

      <p>Flow
      complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
      Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
      information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Flow has certified to the Department of
      Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any
      conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield
      Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the
      Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles and to view our
      certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/"
      target="_blank">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Flow's participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal data that is
      subject to the Privacy Policy and is received from the European Union and European

      it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third
      party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Flow remains
      responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party
      agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a
      manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Flow proves that it is not
      responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. </p>

        you to contact us should you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general

        (DPAs) and comply with the information and advice provided to it by an informal
        panel of DPAs in relation to such unresolved complaints (as further described
        in the Privacy Shield Principles). If you have an
        unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed
        satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution

        Principles, a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you in
        order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means. Flow is
        subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
        Commission (FTC) and the US Department of Transportation.
