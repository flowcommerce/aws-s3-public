class="c8"><p class="c4"><span class="c0">International Order Terms and Conditions for the Purchase of Goods</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Flow is the Seller of the Goods. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Various suppliers have partnered with Flow Commerce Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (&ldquo;Flow&rdquo;) as a fulfillment provider to process and facilitate orders for goods on their website (&ldquo;International Orders&rdquo;). The goods you are about to buy are an International Order and governed by these International Order Terms and Conditions. By confirming your International Order, you indicate that you accept and agree to these International Order Terms and Conditions in addition to any other terms and conditions required in relation to your purchase. In the event that these International Order Terms and Conditions conflict with other terms and conditions set by the supplier in relation to an International Order, these International Order Terms and Conditions shall apply. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The characteristics of the goods in the International Order, as well as the price, delivery and shipping costs and (if available for pre-payment) taxes and duties, shall be those displayed to you at the checkout (or similar) facility, operated by Flow. Please make sure you review your checkout page so that you can identify and correct any input errors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Where we refer to &ldquo;Consumer&rdquo; in these Terms we mean an individual acting for purposes which are wholly outside that individual&rsquo;s trade, business, craft or profession. You agree that you will not re-export or re-sell any merchandise purchased by you from Flow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Flow reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any International Order for any reason or no reason, including (but not limited to) the determination that the sale, in our unfettered discretion, would be to the detriment of either Flow or the supplier (which may include, but is not limited to, incorrect pricing). Certain addresses may be ineligible for purchase, including PO box addresses. You agree that by submitting an International Order you are making an offer to purchase the product(s) listed in your shopping cart under these International Order Terms and Conditions and we may choose not to accept any International Order. When completing your purchase on the supplier&rsquo;s website and related checkout page, you will be providing your payment details, shipping address and any additional information required to complete your order directly to Flow, and not to the supplier itself. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c3">You place an International Order by selecting the merchandise, placing it in the shopping cart (or basket, or any similar facility operated by the supplier) and transmitting the order by clicking &ldquo;PLACE ORDER&rdquo; button (or similar button) through the Checkout. This process permits you to check and amend any errors before making an order by using the &ldquo;back&rdquo; button. You must be at least 18 years of age (or any age legally required under local law where you are resident to bind yourself legally to these terms). By doing so, you confirm to us that you meet this requirement. We do not accept your International Order (and therefore we make no commitment to provide you with the merchandise), and no contract for the sale of such merchandise shall come into effect, until we specifically accept your International Order and you are notified by email that the merchandise is being shipped to you. You are advised that there may be minor differences between the actual merchandise and the way that it appears on the relevant website, e.g., in relation to appearance / color / texture / finish. The labelling or packaging of the merchandise may differ from the images of these which you see on the site</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Any payment associated with an International Order will be processed and accepted directly by Flow, as the seller of the goods to you (&ldquo;Merchant of Record&rdquo;). For sales originating from Canada, the Merchant of Record is Flow Commerce Canada Inc., a Canada corporation, with its registered address at Suite 2400, 745 Thurlow Street, Vancouver British Columbia V6E 0CS, with a company number of BC1159587. For sales originating in either the EU or the UK, the Merchant of Record is Flow Commerce Limited, a private company limited by shares, with its registered address at 2nd Floor, Palmerston House, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland, with a VAT number of IE 3438168MH. The supplier may provide the shipping to you, and if it does, it does so as a subcontractor of Flow. In addition, where it is required by law, rule or regulation, or where you elect to pre&shy;pay any applicable duties and taxes, Flow will collect any such duties and taxes with your payment and make payment to the appropriate taxing authority on your behalf. When Flow receives your payment details and any additional information related to your International Order, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Flow is entitled to verify and authenticate your payment information, and if it is unable to verify this information, a Flow representative may contact you and/or your payment card issuer to confirm your identity and/or your intent to place the order. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If the merchandise originates in the United States or Canada, immediately before your International Order is handed to the carrier, title in the goods will transfer to you. If the goods originate in any other country, title to the goods will transfer to you in transport. Flow will then direct shipment of the goods by common carrier for delivery to the address indicated in your International Order.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Flow&rsquo;s Privacy Policy. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">Flow&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, which applies to Flow&rsquo;s collection, use, disclosure and other processing of personal information, is located at </span><span class="c9">https://link.flow.io/policies/privacy</span><span class="c3">. You consent to the personal and other information that Flow may obtain about you being collected, stored and otherwise processed in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Payments: Processing and Accepted in Your Currency. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">All payments collected in relation to International Orders will be processed by one of Flow&rsquo;s third party payment processors (&ldquo;Payment Processor&rdquo;). To learn more about the providers of payment processing, please click </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.flow.io/policies/third-party-payment-providers/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1619662205386000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sKO2-4P35J8Wk_g8pk85I">here</a></span><span class="c3">. At checkout, you may select your preferred currency and payment method from those listed as available currencies and payment methods. Flow will present the purchase price to you in your preferred currency. Please note that prices in different countries and currencies may vary. When you complete and confirm payment, you are indicating that you agree and accept the presented price as the purchase price. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You acknowledge and agree that: (i) one of our Payment Processors will charge you through the payment method you have selected for such International Order and such other amounts payable under these Terms that may be due in connection with the Order; (ii) you will provide valid and current information about yourself; and (iii) we may use the tools, software or services of Payment Processors to process transactions on our behalf.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You agree that neither Flow nor the supplier shall be liable for any issues regarding financial and monetary transactions between you and any other party. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Returns and Customer Service Will Be Provided by Flow and the Suppliers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">You may contact Flow directly via email at </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="mailto:help@flow.io">help@flow.io</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;or at +1 (929) 265-2865. While Flow is the seller of the goods, or Merchant of Record, you may direct any inquiries, questions or comments regarding the goods you have purchased&mdash;including returns and refunds to the suppliers themselves or at our customer service center at </span><span class="c2">help@flow.io</span><span class="c3">. The suppliers will coordinate with Flow as needed to address your concerns. The supplier&rsquo;s published Returns Policy will apply for all International Orders. If Flow&rsquo;s supplier of the good(s) you are purchasing has a return policy that allows for international returns, Flow may extend that supplier&rsquo;s return policy to its consumers as well. You should review the return policy on such supplier&rsquo;s website. Additionally, regardless of whether returns are permitted, Flow has the right to refuse any return if there is a restriction on the product, either applicable to it when exported from your country or imported to the country of return. You acknowledge and agree that for any refunds you shall not receive any interest on the amounts paid. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">EU Consumer Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions, regarding International Orders that have a ship-to address in the European Union, you have a right to cancel your International Order and return most merchandise (subject to the remainder of this paragraph) at any time within 14 days of the day after your receipt of the merchandise. When canceling an International Order and returning merchandise that was shipped to the European Union you may complete a withdrawal form, located at</span><span class="c6 c14">: &nbsp;[LINK].</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;In order to successfully withdraw from a Purchase, you must send back the merchandise within 14 days of notifying us that you are returning the merchandise. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the merchandise purchased while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a right to deduct the cost of any deterioration, up to the price of your Purchase, from the refund to which you are otherwise entitled. This provision does not apply to items that pose a hygiene risk (e.g., underwear and bathing suits), custom-made or personalized items, and sealed audio-visual items (e.g., CDs and DVDs) or software that are unsealed after delivery, unless such merchandise was damaged or faulty when delivered to you. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If you have paid Duties, Taxes and Fees in connection with your International Order you must seek reimbursement directly from the applicable authority to whom these were paid.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If any merchandise you order is damaged or faulty when delivered to you or has developed a fault, you may have one or more legal remedies available to you, depending on when you make us aware of the problem, in accordance with your legal rights. If you believe merchandise was delivered damaged or faulty or has developed a fault, you should inform us as soon as possible, preferably in writing, giving your name, address and order reference. Nothing in this section affects your legal rights.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">General Terms. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By placing your International Order, you indicate that you agree and accept the following terms: </span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Flow has no obligation to process the payment for your order until the order has been accepted, and Flow reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion.</span></li><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;In the event that a product was listed, sold, or processed with an incorrect price, Flow has the right to contact you, fix the price (with your consent) and/or cancel your order. </span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;To fulfill your order, Flow utilizes contracted third parties under confidentiality and data protection requirements. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you elect to use a payment card or other electronic form of payment for purchase of your International Order, the charges to your account will be accompanied by a descriptor referencing Flow and/or the supplier. </span></li><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;For your protection, Flow utilizes various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud. As a condition of accepting your International Order, you must comply with such protocols and business risk policies, including but not limited to card authentication and &ldquo;ship to&rdquo; and &ldquo;bill to&rdquo; address verification. Once an order is placed, you may not change payment information or any &ldquo;ship to&rdquo;/&ldquo;bill to&rdquo; address. If a request for an International Order is declined by Flow or the supplier but payment is processed due to an error in the Flow payment system, that transaction shall be void. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;In the event that any items in your International Order are shipped separately or at different times, or in the event that your International Order is partially filled, you will only be charged for the goods actually shipped to you, including any shipping fees, duties, taxes, VAT and/or other fees applicable to those goods. </span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-1"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&#9679;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;We may deliver different parts of your order on different dates. Unless otherwise stated, and subject to applicable laws, delivery dates given on the retailer&rsquo;s delivery page and/or as part of the checkout process are estimates only. Your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the order confirmation email or, if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days after the date of the order confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Delivery timeframes are affected by your delivery address and the delivery method selected. We are unable to specify an exact delivery date and time. We have no liability for any losses arising from delay in delivery to the extent that this is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control and where we could not have taken reasonable steps to deal with the delay. For example, delays resulting from customs clearance procedures or other actions of relevant authorities are generally outside our control, or delays resulting directly from your actions or omissions. </span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Customs, Duties, Taxes and Collection Fees. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You are responsible for payment of the estimated value of any import taxes, sales tax, value added tax, and customs duties that may be levied by any government authority, and any disbursement fees, advancement fees or similar fees that may be imposed by the shipper, broker, the customs authority of the destination country or other party, including any additional penalties or fees imposed by applicable tax or customs authorities (collectively, &ldquo;Duties, Taxes and Fees&rdquo;). Flow shall be liable for any difference in the estimated Duties, Taxes and Fees and the actual Duties, Taxes and Fees due and payable upon entry to the destination country. You will never be asked to pay additional Duties, Taxes and Fees after checkout, nor will you be entitled to receive a refund of any portion of the estimated Duties, Taxes and Fees. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For certain delivery destinations and/or International Orders, you may be offered the option to pre-pay applicable Duties, Taxes and Fees, which will then be calculated and included in the final price when you place an International Order. You acknowledge that such Duties, Taxes and Fees are set by the delivery destination and therefore may vary. In the event that the option to pre-pay applicable Duties, Taxes and Fees is available for you and you choose to pre-pay such Duties, Taxes and Fees, your final price will be fully guaranteed by Flow, and Flow will be fully responsible for paying the actual Duties, Taxes and Fees as will be determined by your delivery destination upon import of your International Order. However, if you do not pre-pay Duties, Taxes and Fees: (a) you are advised that the amount of Duties, Taxes and Fees displayed under the pre-pay option on the Checkout may not reflect the actual Duties, Taxes and Fees payable by you as determined by your delivery destination&rsquo;s relevant authority, which may be more or less than such estimate; and (b) you will be fully responsible for paying all applicable Duties, Taxes and Fees directly to the relevant authority (and for reclaiming them in the event of a cancellation or return or a return of merchandise, to the extent permitted in the these Terms) as determined by the authorities of the delivery destination, and Flow shall have no responsibility or liability in connection with the foregoing.
