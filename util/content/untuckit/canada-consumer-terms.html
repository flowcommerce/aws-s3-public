For Canada Orders, Untuckit may provide the shipping to you on Flow's behalf.

Certain addresses may be ineligible for purchase, including PO box addresses. You agree that by submitting a Canada Order you are making an offer to purchase the Untuckit product(s) listed in your shopping cart under these Online Canada Terms and we may choose not to accept any Canada Order. A Canada Order may be cancelled by Flow at any time until the product(s) is shipped.
